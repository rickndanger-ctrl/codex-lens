/**
 * Issues the approval for the execution plan this run generated.
 *
 * An execution plan is minted here, with a fresh id and digest, so no approval
 * that predates the run can name it. An issuer is what lets a caller approve
 * the plan it is actually shown: it receives the generated plan and answers
 * with a contract bound to it, or `undefined` for "not approved". Whatever it
 * returns still faces the same binding check as a caller-supplied contract, so
 * an issuer is a way to be asked, not a way to self-authorize.
 *
 * The plan an issuer is handed is a frozen deep copy, not the plan that runs.
 * The threat is an issuer that approves the plan it is shown and then edits
 * that object into another one — widening `expectedCommands` or the file lists
 * after the digest it signed was read. The binding check recomputes the digest,
 * and `createExecutionPlan` already
 * returns a frozen plan, so today the attempt throws either way; handing over a
 * copy and freezing it here is what stops that from being a property this
 * module merely inherits from a schema in another package and would lose
 * silently if that schema ever dropped `.readonly()`.

 * nothing. A plan this orchestrator cannot carry out — one naming deletions,
 * see `PLAN_DELETIONS_UNSUPPORTED` — is refused next, while refusing is still
 * free. Auth is proven after that, before the sandbox exists: Codex with no
 * credentials cannot make the edit, and finding that out after the copy would
 * leave a working copy behind for no reason.
 *
 * Every write happens inside a disposable sandbox — the requested repo itself
 * is never touched — and an edit the tests reject is rolled back to its
 * baseline rather than handed back half-applied.
 *
 * The approval binds the plan's file lists, so `applyEdit` holds Codex's answer
 * to them: an edit to a file the plan does not name, or names for a different
 * purpose, fails the run rather than landing. Approving a plan is what
 * authorizes the edit, and the plan a reviewer read names the files it touches.
 *
 * A Failed Result means the change was not made. It normally also means nothing
 * was left behind — with one exception it names rather than hides: if the
 * sandbox could not be removed, the failure is `SANDBOX_CLEANUP_FAILED` and
 * carries the surviving sandbox's handle. Read it with
 * `readSandboxCleanupFailure` and dispose the copy; nobody else holds it.
 *
 * A successful Result means the run completed and reported on itself: read
 * `status` to learn whether the edit survived verification, and dispose the
